# intership_project
During my internship at Kryosync in the Web Development Department, I worked under the guidance of Mr. Harshil Trivedi. My main task was to design and develop a responsive personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created multiple interactive sections including About Me, Projects, Resume Download, and Contact, and implemented scroll-based animations using ScrollReveal.js for a modern user experience. This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills, understand mobile-first design, and gain practical experience in developing professional web interfaces.
